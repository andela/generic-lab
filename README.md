#Generic Lab
This is the boiler plate from which all other labs should evolve from.

+ Edit the `LabSlug` and `CategoryId` javascript variables to their pertient values

+ The test specs should be written in the _generic-tests.js_ script. The _generic.js_ file is the script that should contain the solution for the test and should be left *blank*, or as the case may be, a boiler plate for the solution, but under no circumstances should the solution for the test be present in any commits to the repository.

+ Rename the javascript files _generic.js_ and _generic-tests.js_ to their appropriate file names. Repeat this in their script tag references in _index.html_
+ The page title in _index.html_ should also be renamed to suit purpose.

+ This README should be modified as well, with this section describing the lab's tests and or function required to pass it, as eloquent as possible.


## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\generic.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
